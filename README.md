## Aim

This project aims to classify 2D-transformed and preprocessed electrocardiograms (ECG) signals into four different categories, including normal sinus rhythm (NSR), atrial fibrillation (AF), other, and noisy ECG. The preproccsing involves bandpass-filtering between 0.5 and 50 Hz. SUbsequently, the 2D-transforms are generated using the so-called continuous wavelet transformation (CWT), so the ECG is represented in the time-frequency domain. Users should be able to upload the 2D-transformed ECG data and receive a classification result indicating the type of signal. This project will utilize the CACHET-CADB (Copenhagen Center for Health Technology - Contextualized Arrhythmia Database) provided by DTU Health. We are using a subset of the dataset that contains only the ECG recordings. It contains 1602 ten-second long ECG samples of AF, NSR, noise, and other rhythm classes, which are manually annotated by two cardiologists. The ECG is sampled at 1024 Hz and a 12-bit resolution. The dataset can be found in Kumar, Devender, et al. "CACHET-CADB: A contextualized ambulatory electrocardiography arrhythmia dataset." Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine 9 (2022): 893090.

The dataset is split into a training, validation, and test set in a stratified manner, so the data distribution is preserved in each set. The goal is to develope a consistent, reproducible, and efficient framework, so it can be used by other researchers within the healthcare or machine learning community.


## Model

The chosen architecture is EfficientNet-B7, known for its efficiency and performance in image classification tasks. It is a convolutional neural network (CNN) from 2019. A pretrained model was downloaded from Pytorch and fine-tuned. See the original publication in Tan, Mingxing, and Quoc Le. "Efficientnet: Rethinking model scaling for convolutional neural networks." International conference on machine learning. PMLR, 2019. We are using PyTorch Lightning for model training and evaluation easier.


## Frameworks and Libraries

The project utilizes the following frameworks and libraries:
- Hydra for configuration management
- PyTorch Lightning for model training and evaluation
- Docker for containerization
- UV for python package management
